## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of VSDBabySoC.
> [!TIP]
> Before diving into the Post-Synthesis Simulation of the VSDBabySoC, letâ€™s first recall what synthesis and GLS mean in the SoC design flow.
> ### What is Synthesis?
> Synthesis is the process of converting the RTL (Register Transfer Level) description of a design â€” written in Verilog or VHDL â€” into a gate-level netlist. In simpler terms, it translates human-readable logic into a network of standard cells (like AND, OR, DFF, etc.) available in a specific technology library.<br>
> This step ensures that the design is now represented in a form that can actually be fabricated on silicon. The synthesis tool (like Yosys) optimizes the RTL logic to meet the required constraints such as area, power, and timing, and outputs a gate-level Verilog file (`netlist.v`) along with synthesis logs and reports.
> ### What is Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)?
> Once synthesis is done, we need to verify that the synthesized netlist still behaves the same way as the RTL description. This is done through Gate-Level Simulation (GLS).<br>
> GLS involves simulating the gate-level netlist (post-synthesis Verilog file) with the same testbench used for RTL simulation. This helps us confirm:
> * The logical functionality of the synthesized circuit matches the RTL.
> * The design is free from synthesis-induced issues like uninitialized nets, mismatched ports, or incorrect optimizations.
