## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of VSDBabySoC.
> [!TIP]
> Before diving into the Post-Synthesis Simulation of the VSDBabySoC, letâ€™s first recall what synthesis and GLS mean in the SoC design flow.
> ### What is Synthesis?
> Synthesis is the process of converting the RTL (Register Transfer Level) description of a design â€” written in Verilog or VHDL â€” into a gate-level netlist. In simpler terms, it translates human-readable logic into a network of standard cells (like AND, OR, DFF, etc.) available in a specific technology library.<br>
> This step ensures that the design is now represented in a form that can actually be fabricated on silicon. The synthesis tool (like Yosys) optimizes the RTL logic to meet the required constraints such as area, power, and timing, and outputs a gate-level Verilog file (`netlist.v`) along with synthesis logs and reports.
> ### What is Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)?
> Once synthesis is done, we need to verify that the synthesized netlist still behaves the same way as the RTL description. This is done through Gate-Level Simulation (GLS).<br>
> GLS involves simulating the gate-level netlist (post-synthesis Verilog file) with the same testbench used for RTL simulation. This helps us confirm:
> * The logical functionality of the synthesized circuit matches the RTL.
> * The design is free from synthesis-induced issues like uninitialized nets, mismatched ports, or incorrect optimizations.

### <ins>1. Synthesis of the Netlist.</ins>
1. **Step 1: Navigate to Module Directory & Launch Yosys**<br>
   Change the current directory to where the Verilog source files are located and start the Yosys synthesis tool.
   ```
   cd [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/module/
   yosys
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/1.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
2. **Step 2: Read Verilog Source Files**<br>
   Load the Verilog design files into Yosys for synthesis. The `-I` option specifies an additional include directory for any header or included files.
   ```
   read_verilog -I [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/include vsdbabysoc.v rvmyth.v clk_gate.v
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/2.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>   
3. **Step 3: Load Standard Cell Libraries**<br>
   Import the Liberty format (`.lib`) timing and cell information files for the different modules and the target technology. These libraries provide Yosys with cell definitions, delays, and drive strengths for synthesis and mapping.
   ```
   read_liberty -lib [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib
   read_liberty -lib [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib
   read_liberty -lib [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/3.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>   
4. **Step 4: Synthesize Top Module**<br>
   Perform RTL-to-gate-level synthesis for the top-level module `vsdbabysoc`, converting Verilog code into a technology-independent gate-level representation.
   ```
   synth -top vsdbabysoc
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/4.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/5.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/6.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/7.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/8.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
5. **Step 5: Map Flip-Flops to Standard Cells**<br>
   Map all the D flip-flops in the design to the corresponding flip-flop cells from the provided standard cell library (`sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`).
   ```
   dfflibmap -liberty [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/9.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
6. **Step 6: Optimize the Design**<br>
   Perform general logic optimizations to simplify the circuit and reduce area, delay, and redundant logic.
   ```
   opt
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/10.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/11.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
7. **Step 7: Technology Mapping with ABC**<br>
   Run the ABC tool to map the synthesized design to the target standard-cell library, applying logic optimization, retiming, and decomposition steps to generate an efficient gate-level netlist.
   ```
   abc -liberty [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib -script +strash;scorr;ifraig;retime;{D};strash;dch,-f;map,-M,1,{D}
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/12.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/13.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
8. **Step 8: Flatten the Design and Clean Up**<br>
   * `flatten`: Collapse all module hierarchies into a single top-level design.
   * `setundef -zero`: Set all undefined signals to logic 0.
   * `clean -purge`: Remove unused cells and nets.
   * `rename -enumerate`: Rename all remaining signals and cells systematically for clarity.
   ```
   flatten
   setundef -zero
   clean -purge
   rename -enumerate
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/14.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
9. **Step 9: Design Statistics**<br>
   Run the `stat` command to display a summary of the current design, including the number of cells, wires, and hierarchical modules, helping you assess the complexity and size of the synthesized netlist.
   ```
   stat
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/15.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/16.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
10. **Step 10: Write Synthesized Netlist**<br>
   Use the `write_verilog` command to export the optimized gate-level netlist to a Verilog file, which can be used for post-synthesis simulations or further design analysis.
   ```
   write_verilog -noattr [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC//output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/17.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>
   
11. **Step 11: Exit Yosys**<br>
   Terminate the Yosys synthesis session and return to the regular terminal shell.
   ```
   exit
   ``` 

### <ins>2. Gate-Level Simulation.</ins>
1. **Step 1: Compile Gate-Level Simulation**<br>
   Compile the gate-level netlist along with the testbench using Icarus Verilog, defining macros for post-synthesis simulation and functional behavior, and including necessary directories for source and GLS model files.
   ```
   iverilog -o [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 -I [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/module -I [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/gls_model -I [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
   ```
2. **Step 2: Navigate to Output Directory**<br>
   Change the current directory to the post-synthesis simulation output folder to access the compiled simulation files and results.
   ```
   cd [path to your VSDBabySoC directory]/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/
   ```
3. **Step 3: Run Post-Synthesis Simulation**<br>
   Execute the compiled simulation binary to verify that the gate-level netlist produces the expected functional outputs.
   ```
   ./post_synth_sim.out
   ```
4. **Step 4: View Simulation Waveforms in GTKWave**<br>
   Open the generated VCD (Value Change Dump) file in GTKWave to visually inspect the signal transitions and verify the correctness of the post-synthesis simulation.
   ```
   gtkwave post_synth_sim.vcd
   ```
   <div align="center">
     <img src="Images/18.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
   </div>

### <ins>3. Output in GTKWave.</ins>
<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/VSDBabySoC_GLS_GTKWave.png" alt="Alt Text" width="1000"/>
</div>

### <ins>4. The Synthesis Logs.</ins>
The screenshots of the synthesis logs, captured from the terminal, are provided under each corresponding command. These screenshots display the username and timestamps for reference. Note that timestamps could not be captured while running Yosys, as it does not natively support this feature; however, timestamps are visible outside the Yosys environment.<br>
For certain commands, the logs could not be displayed in full within the screenshots due to their extensive length. In these cases, only the beginning and end portions of the command outputs are shown. For those interested in reviewing the complete synthesis logs, the entire terminal output has been exported as a log file, which can be accessed [here.](VSDBabySoC_GLS_Bitopan.log)

### <ins>5. Analysis after GLS.</ins>
After completing both the RTL simulations and gate-level simulations (GLS) of the VSDBabySoC design, a comparison of the outputs was performed using GTKWave. The key observations are as follows:
1. **Functional Equivalence:**
   The outputs of the gate-level simulation exactly match the outputs from the RTL simulation, confirming that the synthesis and subsequent technology mapping have preserved the intended functionality of the design.
2. **Timing and Signal Integrity:**
   No unexpected glitches or incorrect transitions were observed in the GLS outputs. All signals behaved as expected under the defined testbench stimuli, indicating that the design is stable and timing-correct at the synthesized level.
3. **Conclusion:**
   The successful verification of GLS against RTL simulations validates that the synthesized netlist is functionally equivalent to the RTL design. This confirms the correctness of the synthesis flow, cell mapping, and the overall implementation of the VSDBabySoC.
